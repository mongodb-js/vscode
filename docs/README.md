# design

- using process developed with @rueckstiess 
- design -> not writing gdocs etc.
- instead start work -> document -> export stakeholder reports (fancy way of saying update lightweight JIRA tickets)

## "groundrules"

> (again, put the right work out first, report formats far second)

- GitHub PR ready for review -> everything happens here
- sketches, snippets, links, images, example/test scripts go in this directory :arrow_right: make pretty as design PR progresses
- GitHub issues/projects/milestones are in the mix if they work 
- TODO: lucas: something code of conduct like about attribution but cant find the words yet
