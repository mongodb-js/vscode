name: Nightly build failures

# This workflow is triggered when the "Test and Build" workflow fails on the scheduled run on the "main" branch.
# The purpose of this workflow is to allow our Slack GitHub bot to subscribe to it and only report failures
# related to nightly builds, rather than all workflow runs.
