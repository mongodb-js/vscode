## Development

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the VSCode extension documentation:
[code.visualstudio.com/api](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).

Running the MongoDB VSCode plugin requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm.

1. Clone this project, navigate to the folder, then run:
```shell
npm install
npm run watch
```

2. Inside of [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) open this directory and press `F5` to begin debugging the extension. This should launch a new VSCode window which is running the extension.
