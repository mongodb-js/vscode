# MongoDB for VS Code ![PREVIEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PREVIEW-orange)

[![Build Status][azure_img]][azure_url]

**MongoDB for VS Code** lets you easily work with MongoDB directly from your VS Code environment. Using the MongoDB Extension, you can:

- Connect to a MongoDB instance or cluster
- Navigate your databases and collections
- Prototype queries and aggregations

MongoDB for VS Code is still a work in progress and is **not yet released**.

## Installing the extension

MongoDB for VS Code can be installed in 2 ways.

You can clone this repository and install the extension in your VS Code with:

```shell
npm install
npm run local-install
```

This will compile and package MongoDB for VS Code into a `.vsix` file and add the extension to your VS Code.

Alternatively, you can download the prebuild `.vsix` package from the [releases page](https://github.com/mongodb-js/vscode/releases) and install it with the following command:

```shell
code --install-extension /path/to/mongodb-vscode-x.y.z.vsix
```

If you get an error because the `code` command is not found, you need to install it in your `$PATH`.
Open VS Code, launch the Commmand Palette (⌘+Shift+P on MacOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows and Linux), type `code` and select "Install code command in \$PATH".

- `mdb.show`: Show or hide the MongoDB view.
- `mdb.defaultLimit`: The number of documents to fetch when viewing documents from a collection.
