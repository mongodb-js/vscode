**MongoDB for VS Code** lets you easily work with MongoDB directly from your VS Code environment. Using the MongoDB Extension, you can:

* Prototype queries and aggregations


MongoDB for VS Code is still a work in progress and is **not yet released**.

* Navigate your database and collections
* See the documents in your collections
* Get a quick overview of your schema

### MongoDB Playgrounds
* Prototype your queries, aggregations and MongoDB commands with MongoDB Syntax Highlighting
* Run your playgrounds and see the results instantly
* Save your playgrounds in your workspace and use them to document how your application interacts with MongoDB
* Build aggregations quickly with our helpful and well commented stage snippets


### Quick access to the MongoDB Shell
* Launch the MongoDB Shell from the command palette to quickly connect to the same cluster you have active in VS Code
